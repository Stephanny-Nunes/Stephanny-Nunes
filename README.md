Hi there! My name is Stephanny Nunes. I am a Mechanical Engineer currently trying to understand more about Data Science and Machine Learning.

I live in Dublin, Ireland but I was born and raised in Brazil. 

The subject I am studying right now is Natural Language Processing and its application using Python to run the model.
